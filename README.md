I decided to work on an application for the parents of young players of a handball club that will display the matches with all the important information for them (date, time, address of the gym, and a customizable comment). 

This application will communicate with a webservice configured on a server, which will return the list of matches to be displayed and will take into account the various modifications in the matches (change of date, addition of the score, deletion ...).

For this, I developed 2 applications: one on the server side (the webservice) and a public application that can be installed on the parents' phones. The server application will have to be installed directly on a dedicated server.

These applications are available on the following links: 

- The public application HBCVM: https://github.com/ArnaudKif/HBCVM 

- The server application HBVVM_DB : https://github.com/ArnaudKif/HBCVM_DB
